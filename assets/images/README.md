# Profile Picture Setup

## Instructions

Add your profile picture to this folder with the name:
```
profile.jpg
```

### Steps:

1. **Choose your photo** - Select a professional photo of yourself
   - Recommended: Professional headshot or clear portrait
   - Good lighting and clear background work best

2. **Image Requirements**:
   - **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - **Size**: Recommended 500x500px to 1000x1000px (square format works best)
   - **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
   - **Quality**: High quality but optimized for web

3. **Rename the file** to `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png`)

4. **Copy it to this folder**:
   - Full path: `c:\Users\black\OneDrive\Desktop\Android developer Portfolio\assets\images\profile.jpg`

5. If you use PNG format, update the HTML:
   ```html
   <img src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="Maviya Shaik - Flutter Developer">
   ```

### Image Optimization Tips:

- Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh to compress your image
- Crop to square aspect ratio (1:1) for best results
- Ensure good contrast and visibility
- Professional attire recommended

### File Structure:
```
assets/
  └── images/
      ├── profile.jpg  (Your photo goes here)
      ├── .gitkeep
      └── README.md    (This file)
```

---

**Current Setup**: The portfolio is set to display `profile.jpg`

If you don't have a photo yet, the placeholder icon will show instead.
